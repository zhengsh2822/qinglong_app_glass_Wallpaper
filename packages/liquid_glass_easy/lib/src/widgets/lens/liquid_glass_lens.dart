/// A liquid-glass lens you can place **anywhere in the widget tree**.
///
/// Unlike the `children:` slot of `LiquidGlassView`, this lens is
/// layout-driven: it has no position or size parameters — it is exactly
/// where layout puts it and exactly as big as its constraints/[child]
/// make it (wrap it in a `SizedBox` to give it explicit dimensions).
///
/// ## Render modes (resolved automatically)
///
/// * **Impeller** (`ImageFilter.isShaderFilterSupported`): the lens
///   refracts the live backdrop — whatever your app painted behind it.
///   No `LiquidGlassView` and **no background widget needed at all**;
///   drop it over any UI and it works.
/// * **Skia / Web with an ancestor [LiquidGlassView]** that has a
///   `backgroundWidget`: the lens refracts the view's captured
///   background, wherever the lens sits inside the view's `child`.
/// * **Skia / Web without a view (or without a background)**: refraction
///   is impossible, so the lens degrades to a frosted look — backdrop
///   blur + tint + border, no refraction — and logs a one-time debug
///   warning.
///
/// The mode is an implementation detail: the widget tree you write is
/// identical in all three cases.
///
/// ## Lenses inside scrollables (Impeller)
///
/// Android's stretch overscroll effect isolates the scrollable's
/// content into its own compositing layer while the stretch plays. A
/// `BackdropFilter`-based lens inside that layer can no longer see the
/// real backdrop and renders **black** at both scroll edges. Disable
/// the overscroll indicator for scrollables that contain lenses:
///
/// ```dart
/// ScrollConfiguration(
///   behavior: const MaterialScrollBehavior().copyWith(overscroll: false),
///   child: ListView(children: [ ...LiquidGlassLens(...)... ]),
/// )
