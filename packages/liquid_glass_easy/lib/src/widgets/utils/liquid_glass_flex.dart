/// Touch-driven **soft-body deformation** for a lens that does not move.
///
/// Press a lens and it compresses under your finger; drag and it elongates
/// along the pull, pinches in the cross axis, and leans after your finger —
/// then springs back with a wobble when you let go.
///
/// ## The model: four independent edges
///
/// Unlike a scale transform — which can only grow symmetrically around one
/// anchor — this moves the lens's **left, right, top and bottom edges
/// independently**. That is what makes it read as *soft*: the half of the
/// shape nearest your finger deforms more than the far half.
///
/// The grab point drives that split. Grab near the right edge and pull
/// right: the right edge shoots out while the left barely follows. Grab
/// dead centre and the same pull elongates both sides evenly. [grip]
/// controls how localized this is (`0` = fully symmetric, `1` = fully
/// local).
///
/// ## Volume is preserved, not gained
///
/// Whatever the along-axis edges gain, the cross-axis edges give back:
/// `(w + g)·(h - loss) = w·h`. Elongate horizontally and it genuinely gets
/// *thinner*. [squeeze] scales that give-back (`1` = full preservation,
/// `0` = none).
///
/// ## Hold and tap are separate responses
///
/// [holdScale] resizes the lens for as long as the finger stays down — the
/// swell of a control being held. [tapScale] is a one-shot pop fired the
/// moment a tap *completes*, so a quick click still reads as a click even
/// though nothing was held long enough for the hold to arrive. Both are
/// signed: positive swells, negative yields inward.
///
/// A press also deepens the optics
/// ([LiquidGlassFlexAdvanced.refractionBoost]), which is what makes the
/// surface read as glass being compressed rather than as a rubber button
/// popping.
///
/// ## Only nine knobs
///
/// Everything you would reach for while dialling in a feel is a direct
/// parameter. The five that are set once and forgotten — content follow,
/// optical boost, and the three spring constants — live in
/// [LiquidGlassFlexAdvanced] behind [advanced], so they stay out of the
/// way without being out of reach.
