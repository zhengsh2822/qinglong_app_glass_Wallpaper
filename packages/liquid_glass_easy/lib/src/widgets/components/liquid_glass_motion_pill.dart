/// The sliding thumb's whole thumb effect as one
/// isolated, reusable component: the two-state morph (contracted ↔
/// expanded glass), the acceleration squash / stretch
/// ([LiquidGlassLensMotion]), and the driven-lens rendering — so the
/// same living glass pill can ride a slider track, a bottom nav bar, or
/// anything else that moves it.
///
/// ## Division of labour
///
/// The HOST owns position and gesture: where the pill's centre is each
/// frame (drags, glide springs, rubber bands — whatever its own model
/// produces) and when the pill is grabbed. This widget owns everything
/// the thumb itself did:
///
///  * **Morph.** While [active], the pill spring-grows from [restSize]
///    to [activeSize] (0.4 s, ζ 0.6 — overshoot included); on
///    deactivation it contracts on the softer spring (0.6 s, ζ 0.7).
///    The optional [cover] (e.g. the slider's white rest pill) fades
///    out as the glass arrives, so the two read as one crossfade.
///  * **Squash/stretch.** While [active], [center] is sampled every
///    frame into the acceleration model; the resulting deviation scales
///    the pill oppositely on the two axes. Tracking starts on
///    activation and resets instantly when the contract-back begins.
///  * **Rendering.** The deformation is not a rebuilt capsule: the
///    lens renders at its REST (morph) size and the size change rides
///    the shader's `u_shapeScale` + matching clip scale via
///    [LiquidGlassLens], so the end caps go elliptical instead of
///    the shape being re-rounded at each new size — with the refraction
///    band counter-scaled so it keeps its authored width at stretched
///    caps.
///
/// ## Embedding
///
/// The widget fills whatever box the host gives it and positions the
/// (overflowing) pill at [center] in that box's coordinates — place it
/// as the `child` of a `LiquidGlassView`, or anywhere a
/// [LiquidGlassLens] can render. The host just rebuilds with the
/// new [center]; this widget's own ticker does the sampling.
