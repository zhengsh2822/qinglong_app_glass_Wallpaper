/// Self-contained **animated** liquid-glass bottom nav bar — the iOS-26
/// "morphing glass pill" that slides between tabs, grows out of the rest
/// highlight, can be picked up with a press-and-hold on the selected pill
/// and dragged, and reveals the selected icon as it passes.
///
/// This is the internal machinery behind
/// [LiquidGlassTabBar.glassPill]: it owns the entire dual
/// `LiquidGlassView` pipeline and is built by
/// [LiquidGlassTabBar.buildGlassPillBar] (which
/// `LiquidGlassScaffold` calls when the bar's `glassPill` mode resolves
/// for the active renderer). Prefer configuring it through
/// [LiquidGlassTabBar] — constructing it directly still works, but
/// it will be hidden from the public API in 3.0.
///
/// ## How the pill deforms
///
/// The BAR runs [LiquidGlassLensMotion], not the glass widget: its drawn
/// position is sampled every frame in PIXELS, differentiated twice, and
/// the averaged acceleration scales it oppositely on the two axes —
///
///     scaleX = 1 + d      scaleY = 1 − d
///
/// Force, not speed: the pill deforms hardest as it launches off a tab
/// and as it brakes into the next, and sits undeformed at constant
/// speed. There is no lean term, so it deforms about its centre and
/// travels on the spring alone.
///
/// Under a **finger** the sign is the force's own, so the pill answers
/// the hand: push it right and it stretches wide, push it left and it
/// squashes narrow and tall.
///
/// A **travel** takes the same magnitudes but keys the sign to the
/// direction it is going ([_travelSign]) — a tap to the left stretches
/// the pill for the whole trip, a tap to the right holds it narrow and
/// tall. Signed on the force, a journey contradicted itself: the launch
/// pulled one way and the braking the other, and only the braking was
/// still on screen when you looked at the tab you had chosen. The
/// landing is unchanged; the launch now agrees with it.
///
/// Because the model reads the position the pill is actually drawn at,
/// every motion feeds it and none needs special-casing: a drag-release
/// snap genuinely IS a travel, and its braking is exactly the landing
/// deformation you want.
///
/// It lives on the bar because the deformation belongs to the selection
/// pill as a thing, not to whichever widget is drawing it this frame. The
/// glass and the plain pill are both drawn at the size it produces, so it
/// runs unbroken across the hand-off between them — and it outlives the
/// glass, which is where the landing squash actually happens.
///
/// ## How the deformation is drawn
///
/// The pill is a [LiquidGlassNavBarMotionPill] — a lens widget — in the
/// outer view's `child:` slot. Its shape is evaluated at the ENVELOPE
/// (rest) size and the deformation rides the shader's `u_shapeScale` with
/// matching elliptical clips, so the outline STRETCHES as one body and
/// the end caps go elliptical rather than the capsule being re-rounded at
/// each new size. The outer view's capture is the inner stack, so the
/// pill still bends the bar's own glass.
///
/// One consequence to know about: the view paints its `child:` slot BELOW
/// its positioned `children:`, so the pill sits under [outerLenses]
/// rather than over them. Nothing overlaps a bottom-anchored pill in
/// practice — an app bar is at the top, a side action sits beside the bar
/// — but a host that deliberately put glass over the pill's own cells
/// would see the difference.
///
/// ## How the pill grows
///
/// The lift is a **held state**, not a pass the travel makes through a
/// bigger size. Tap a tab and the pill inflates at once, on springs
/// under critical damping so it overshoots its raised size and rebounds;
/// it stays there for the whole journey; and only once it has landed
/// ([handoverStart]) is the lift released, so it deflates where it
/// stands — dipping a little under its resting size and coming back.
/// A grab is the same thing held open by a finger.
///
/// Each axis carries its own spring, at damping ratios that differ just
/// enough that the width overshoots a shade further and settles a shade
/// later than the height. The material has a third, much faster one, so
/// the glass is fully on long before the size stops moving.
///
/// ## Handing over to the plain pill
///
/// A settled bar draws no glass at all — no shader pass, no clip, no
/// outer capture, no dual-layer icon reveal. The glass gets there by
/// **becoming** the plain pill rather than being cross-faded with one.
///
/// From the landing ([handoverStart]) the lens sheds its glass while
/// everything else keeps running: the rim and its contact shadow go
/// first, then the refraction band narrows to nothing behind them. The
/// deflation and the acceleration squash are untouched throughout — the
/// pill is still shrinking and still deforming while it stops looking
/// like glass.
///
/// Only once there is nothing left in it to see — no glass, no lift, no
/// deformation — is the lens dropped and
/// `LiquidGlassBottomNavPillStatic` put in its place. By then the lens is
/// drawing a flat fill at rest size, which is exactly what the plain pill
/// draws, so the exchange is two identical pictures. That is what keeps
/// the plain pill plain: it never needs the deformation, the stretched
/// outline or an opacity, because it only ever appears once all three
/// have finished.
///
/// [handoverStart] is a target rather than a switch, so tapping another
/// tab mid-hand-off turns the glass straight back around
/// ([glassReturnTau]) instead of finishing and starting over.
///
/// [body] is the page content, captured behind the glass. [outerLenses]
/// are composited in the outer view on top of the bar (e.g. the app bar
/// and the side action button).
