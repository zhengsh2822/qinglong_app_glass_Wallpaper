/// A drop-in liquid-glass switch, in the sliding style where the thumb
/// is picked up and carried rather than snapped between two ends.
///
/// You give it a [value] and an [onChanged] like a regular `Switch`; it
/// owns its own [LiquidGlassView], the colored track, the glass thumb
/// and the whole touch simulation.
///
/// The behaviour it carries:
///
///  * **A two-state thumb.** A contracted solid pill (37×24) morphs into
///    an expanded glass pill (58×38.33) the instant a touch lands
///    (0.4 s, ζ 0.6 — bouncy), and back on release (0.6 s, ζ 0.7). One
///    size + cover-fade morph, since both layers scale in lockstep.
///  * **The thumb rides the finger 1:1**, relative to where it was at
///    touch-down, with a `sqrt(overrun)` rubber band past the two
///    resting positions, saturating at
///    [LiquidGlassSwitchLayout.overshootRoom] — the room the capture view
///    actually reserves, which an unbounded `sqrt` would spend under a
///    mouse. The track never deforms — the give is all in the thumb's
///    overshoot.
///  * **Dragging into an edge toggles early.** Carry the thumb to
///    within 5 px of the far position and the state flips right there —
///    haptic tick, track color cross-fading under your finger (0.25 s)
///    — while the thumb stays held. Dragging back can flip it again.
///  * **Tap vs drag by distance, then time.** A gesture that carried the
///    thumb past `kTouchSlop` is a drag however brief it was — a mouse
///    crosses the whole control inside any tap window. Anything else under
///    150 ms is a tap: haptic, color, thumb spring-gliding across (0.5 s,
///    critically damped), contraction 0.2 s later. A drag that never
///    reached an edge **always toggles on release**, so a
///    long-press-and-release flips the switch.
///  * **Programmatic changes stay calm.** A new [value] arriving from
///    outside while idle glides the thumb and cross-fades the track
///    without ever expanding the thumb.
///
/// ```dart
/// LiquidGlassSwitch(
///   value: _on,
///   onChanged: (v) => setState(() => _on = v),
///   activeColor: const Color(0xFF34C759),
/// )
/// ```
///
/// ## Refraction & the overhang
/// The expanded thumb grows larger than the track, so its overhang
/// samples the (transparent) area around the capsule. The shader honors
/// the captured texel's alpha, so that overhang renders as transparent
/// passthrough instead of a black blob. On the Impeller backdrop path
/// the overhang refracts the live backdrop directly.
///
/// ## Sizing
/// The track's two sizes are parameters here:
///
/// ```dart
/// LiquidGlassSwitch(
///   value: _on,
///   onChanged: (v) => setState(() => _on = v),
///   width: 84,
///   height: 38,
/// )
/// ```
///
/// They size the **track**, not the thumb. For the whole switch in
/// proportion, scale the layout — `layout: const LiquidGlassSwitchLayout()
/// .scaled(1.4)` — and for anything finer, state it on [layout]
/// outright: a [LiquidGlassSwitchLayout] carries the track's width and
/// height, the thumb's resting size and the size it swells to. The
/// resting positions, the travel, the rubber band's limits and the
/// capture view are all derived from those. [width] and [height] are a
/// shorthand for the layout's own two fields and win over them.
///
/// The control's layout footprint is the track alone (63×28 by default)
/// while the glass painted around it is larger: the expanded thumb and
/// its bounce overflow the footprint deliberately and are not clipped to
/// it. See [reserveSwellRoom] if an ancestor clips.
